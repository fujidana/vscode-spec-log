Contributing Guide

**Note**: Keyboard shotcuts in this section are for macOS.

The extension author welcomes contributions from anyone who is interested in improving the extension. Contributions can be in the form of bug reports, feature requests, code changes, or documentation updates.

In case you want to contribute code or documentation, follow the steps below to send a pull request. Unless your fix is trivial, please open an issue to discuss the change before sending a pull request.

1. Fork the repository. Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the repository page on GitHub.
2. Create a new branch.
3. Edit code.
4. Commit the changes and then push the branch to your forked repository.
5. Create a pull request to merge into main branch of `fujidana/vscode-spec-log`.

Setup for extension authoring
----

Here is a step-by-step guide to set up the development environment for the extension, for those who want to contribute code or debug the extension locally.

1. Install VS Code (`code`), Git (`git`), and Node.js (`node`, `npm`).
2. Install `pnpm` by the following command: `npm install --global pnpm`.
3. Clone the original or forked repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/vscode-spec-log.git`. Replace `your_username` with `fujidana` if you want to clone the original repository.
4. Open the cloned folder with VS Code: `cd vscode-spec-log; code .` (or via GUI). In the following, we assume you are in the `vscode-spec-log` folder. The easiest way to do so is to use the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+`).
5. Install Node.js packages the extension depends on: `pnpm install`
6. Execute the following command `pnpm run js-yaml` to convert YAML files (.yaml) manually.
A play button at the right side of "js-yaml" in "NPM SCRIPTS" panel in the "Explorer" viewlet (Cmd+Shift+E) calls the same command. Remember to do the same thing after you modify these files.

Then the setup is complete.
Push a play button in "Run" View (Cmd+Shift+D) or select the menu bar item "Run / Start Debugging" (F5). Then another instance of VS Code will be launched after compilation of source code. The extension running in this VS Code is what you have in your machine and not the one from the marketplace. You can edit code and then check the behavior.

To create a `.vsix` file for local distribution, first install `vsce` by the following: `npm install --global @vscode/vsce`, and then run the following: `vsce package --no-dependencies`.

Update for extension authoring
----

One can pull the latest changes from the remote repository by the following procedure:

1. Open the cloned `vscode-spec-log` folder with VS Code.
2. To pull the latest changes in the remote repository, run `git pull` in the terminal or select "Git: Pull" in the Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P).
3. Resolve conflicts if any.
4. Install new dependencies and updated depndencies by running `pnpm install` in the terminal.
